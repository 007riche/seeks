# number of virtual nodes for a DHT node.
# More virtual nodes make the network stronger.
# On personal computers, more virtual nodes means more bandwith
# consumption, except when the routing option (see below) is set to 0.
# In all cases, more virtual nodes means faster lookups on the DHT
# for the node that hosts them.
# default: 32
number-vnodes 32

# level-1 communication port. 
# level-1 is for DHT low level coms and stabilization.
# default: 8231
l1-port 8231

# level-1 communication max message size in bytes.
# Don't tweak this parameter unless you know what you are doing.
# default: 8192
l1-server-max-msg-bytes 8192

# level-1 communication timeout in seconds.
# This is the maximum amount of time waited by a client when
# issuing a level-1 message on the network.
# default: 5
l1-client-timeout 5

# list of bootstrap nodes from the Seeks network.
# IP addresses and port separated by a space or a tab.
# This option can be repeated for every bootstrap node.
# default: seeks-project.info 8231
bootstrap-node seeks-project.info 8231

# max number of hops allowed when looking a key up.
# Normally the number of required hops is of the order of log(n),
# where n is the number of virtual nodes on the network.
# Because the DHT is dynamic, due to node leaving and others
# entring, it is safer to cap the number of hops.
# Normal users should not have to tweak this value.
# default: 12
max-hops 12

# max number of keys in a virtual node successor list.
# Successor lists allows the DHT to fix itself very quickly whenever
# one or more nodes depart simultaneously. Maintaining a list
# k successors allows to fix cases when up to k direct successors
# to a node depart simultaneously. Such events have a probability
# of an order of magnitude that decreases exponentially with k.
# default: 10
succlist-size 10

# whether virtual nodes of this DHT node are routing queries, i.e. can
# be contacted to help route queries around the DHT ring.
# This is an important option. Routing means that the DHT node IP address
# appears in the routing table of remote nodes. 
# 
# Setting a non routing mode (routing set to 0) is useful in the following 
# cases:
# - your bandwith is low, or your computer is going on & off often (i.e. a
# laptop) so you should not bother routing other nodes lookups.
# - you wish to hide your IP with TOR or any other similar solutions.
# 
# Routing is off by default for a better control of the core Seeks p2p
# network. This may change in the future.
# default: 0
routing 0

# Search group options are below.

# Maximum memory size allocated to the storage of searchgroup.
# I can be understood as the search groups in-memory cache size.
# default: 104857600 (a 100 Mo).
sg-mem-cap 104857600

# Retention delay for in-memory search groups cache, in seconds.
# default: 1800 (30 minutes).
sg-mem-delay 1800

# Maximum file size for the database of search groups.
# Set to -1 means the size is considered 'infinite'.
# default: 104857600 (a 100 Mo).
sg-db-cap 104857600

# Retention delay for search groups in db, in seconds.
# default: 864000 (10 days).
sg-db-delay 864000

# database sync mode. 
# Set to 0 uses a time-based sync, controlled by the db-sync-delay
# option. Set to 1, the db-sync-delay option is ignored and every
# change to the in-memory cache of search groups is immediately 
# sync to the db.
# default: 0
db-sync-mode 0

# sync delay between the in-memory cache of search groups on the
# on-disk retention database. If db-sync-mode is set to 1, this
# option is ignored.
# default: 300 (5 minutes).
db-sync-delay 300

# Maximum number of peers returned per search group, per call.
# Every of these peers can then be contacted directly by the
# client.
# default 20
